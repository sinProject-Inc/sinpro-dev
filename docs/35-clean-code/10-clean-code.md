This is a guide to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable software for TypeScript.

This is an adaptation of Martin's book [Clean Code](https://amzn.to/449nB6q) for our team.

We also referred to [clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) and [clean-code-typescript](https://msakamaki.github.io/clean-code-typescript/).

## Learn

On the [Learn](/learn) screen, you can select sentences and listen to how they are pronounced.

After listening, you can check your own pronunciation through the app.

You can also register new sentences and add new translations.

## Translate

On the [Translate](/translate) screen, people can have spoken conversations with other people who speak different languages.

When you speak, your words will be displayed in the other party's language and you will hear their words in your own language.

This service allows you to converse in your own language and have a conversation with someone who speaks a different language.

## Chat

On the [Chat](/chat) screen, people can converse through text online with people who speak different languages.

Each user sends messages in their native language, and if the participants speak different languages, their messages will be automatically translated.

Additionally, when a participating member speaks in a different language, their message will be translated into the receiver's language.

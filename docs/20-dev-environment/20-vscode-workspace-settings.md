Here are the VSCode workspace settings that we commonly use at sinProject.

## Bracket Pairs

{
	"editor.guides.bracketPairs": true
}
```

## Minimap

Hide Minimap

```json:.vscode/settings.json

## The default end of line character

When creating a new file on Windows, you can specify the line break code as LF (Line Feed).
